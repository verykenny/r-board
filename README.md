# Welcome to rBoard!

rBoard is a web application that combines your refrigerator space and whiteboard into one app-making it easy to manage chores, reminders, and other tasks in your household or for school. On rBoard, users can create a board, known as a whiteboard, add sticky notes to their board, and invite their family or roommates who have signed up to the board to begin adding things as well!
